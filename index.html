        <h1>What Profession Do I Wanna Be?</h1>
        <p>
          The IT job that interests me the most is Cyber Security, specifically
          Ethical Hacking. Ethical hackers are hired by companies to test their
          systems and find weaknesses before real criminals do. Their daily
          tasks include scanning networks, running penetration tests, and
          reporting security risks. I like this role because it feels like your
          the attacker but using that knowledge to protect people and
          organizations. The constant changes in technology also mean the work
          never gets boring.

        <h2>Evaluation of the Job</h2>
        <p>
          This career has many positives. Cyber Security is one of the
          fastest-growing fields, so job opportunities are wide open, and salaries
          are often high. More importantly, the work has a real impact because
          it helps protect sensitive information. However, it also comes with
          challenges. The job can be stressful when dealing with serious
          security threats, and the skills needed must always stay up to date.
          Hackers never stop improving, so ethical hackers can‚Äôt stop learning
          either.

        <h2>Analysis of Skills</h2>
        <p>
          To succeed, an ethical hacker needs knowledge of computer networks,
          operating systems, programming, and security tools. Certifications
          like CEH or CompTIA Security+ are valuable, and soft skills like
          communication are just as important because findings (bugs with in the
          software) must be explained clearly to non-technical people. Right
          now, I already have some basic programming skills and problem-solving
          ability, but I need to learn more about networking, Linux, and
          real-world security practices.

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          To become an Ethical Hacker, I need both technical and personal
          growth. I should focus on learning Python, networking fundamentals,
          and ethical hacking tools, while also practicing how to explain
          technical ideas as simple as possible.
        </p>

        <h2>Action Plan</h2>
        <p>
          My step by step plan is, by the end of this semester, I will finish an
          online Ethical Hacker fundamentals course. Within six months, I will
          practice using tools like Linux on a virtrual machine. In one year, I
          aim to be more fluent at Python language. Along the way, I will
          connect with online communities and professionals for guidance.
